## 🚀 About Me
I am a **Data Scientist at American Express**, working on applying **machine learning and statistical modeling** to real-world financial and customer behavior problems.

I completed my **Ph.D. at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2025**, where my research focused on **machine learning for prognostics, reliability, and survival analysis**, with applications in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and industrial systems.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- 📊 Applied machine learning & data science
- 🔍 Risk modeling, prediction, and decision support
- 🧠 Deep learning for time series & survival analysis
- 🛠️ Translating research models into production-ready solutions
